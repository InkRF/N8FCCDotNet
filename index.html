            <p>Hey there! Thanks for coming on by.</p>
            <p>My name is Justin, otherwise known as InkRF. I'm an electrical engineering student, avid fan of amateur radio, as well as information/physical security. If you want to get in touch with me, you can shoot me a email to my general email at [email goes here], or go to my <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> for more specific contact information.</p>
            <p>If you've come by before, it may look a bit different than before. I decided to finally take a day to learn HTML/CSS to a point were I can make my own website and not have to rely on a 3rd party product. Should you be so inclined, you can look at the not-so-secret source code on my <a href="https://github.com/InkRF/N8FCCDotNet">GitHub account</a>.</p>
            <p>This website is to serve as a home for info about me, my past and current projects, and other information I like to share with the world. Hopefully you'll be able to leave here learning something. What that something is is up to you I suppose. Thanks for coming by!</p>
