# InkRF.net - Welcome to my website!

When I first got my website I ended up using one of those website creators because I didn't know HTML/CSS to where I could make a site on my own. I wanted to learn though before I would need to extend that subscription though as knowing basic HTML/CSS is quite important IMO nowadays. When the time came though to renew, I still never found the time to learn HTML so one Sunday morning I decided to learn HTML/CSS how I like to learn the most, hands on and straight into it. So after watching a YouTube video, here we are.

It sure isn't the prettiest, but its what I was able to get done in-between homework on a weekend. Hopefully I'll be able to learn a bit more about web dev to add that to my arsenal, such as node.js (which at this point I have no clue what it does other than its probably related to Java).

I used VSCode when writing this website, along with using the [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension by Ritwick Dey
